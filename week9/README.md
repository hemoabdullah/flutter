## üì± Application Screenshots

### Home Screen
![Home Screen](./img/Home_screen.png)

**Description:** The main landing screen features three primary navigation options:
- **üì∏ Capture & Edit Photo** - Opens the camera to take a photo and immediately apply filters
- **üé® Explore Filter Gallery** - Browse and test different filters on sample images
- **‚ú® Complete Project Task** - Direct access to the assignment workflow

The home screen uses a clean, modern design with color-coded buttons for easy navigation.

### Camera Capture Interface
![Camera Screen](./img/take_picture.png)

**Description:** The camera interface provides:
- Full-screen camera preview
- Floating action button for photo capture
- Information banner for simulator users
- Real-time camera feed from device
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Technical Note:** In emulators/simulators, you'll see test patterns instead of actual camera feed. This is expected behavior. Use a physical device for full functionality.

---

### Filter Application Screen
![Applying Filters](./img/Applying_filter%20.png)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture & Design Patterns

#### **State Management**
- `ValueNotifier<Color>` for reactive filter color updates
- `StatefulWidget` for camera controller lifecycle management
- `ValueListenableBuilder` for efficient UI rebuilds

#### **Custom Widgets**
- `CarouselFlowDelegate` - Custom `FlowDelegate` for 3D carousel effect
- `FilterSelector` - Stateful carousel with PageController
- `FilterItem` - Reusable filter thumbnail widget
- `PhotoFilterCarousel` - Main filter application screen

#### **Key Flutter Packages**
```yaml
dependencies:
  camera: ^0.10.5+9          # Camera hardware access
  permission_handler: ^11.3.1 # Runtime permissions
  path_provider: ^2.1.3       # File system paths
  cross_file: ^0.3.3          # Cross-platform file handling
```

## üìù Assignment Answers

### **Question 1: Complete Practicum 1 and 2 with Documentation**

#### **Practicum 1: Photo Capture with Flutter Camera**

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Added `camera` plugin dependency to `pubspec.yaml`
2. ‚úÖ Configured Android permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
   <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
   ```
3. ‚úÖ Configured iOS permissions in `Info.plist`:
   ```xml
   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>App needs camera access to take photos</string>
   ```
4. ‚úÖ Created `TakePictureScreen` with `CameraController`
5. ‚úÖ Implemented async camera initialization with `FutureBuilder`
6. ‚úÖ Added photo capture functionality with error handling

**Result:** Successfully implemented camera capture feature that works on both physical devices and provides appropriate feedback in simulators.

---

#### **Practicum 2: Photo Filter Carousel**

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Created `CarouselFlowDelegate` extending `FlowDelegate`
2. ‚úÖ Implemented 3D transformation calculations for carousel items
3. ‚úÖ Built `FilterSelector` widget with `PageController`
4. ‚úÖ Created color filter array using `Colors.primaries`
5. ‚úÖ Applied `ColorBlendMode` to images for filter effects
6. ‚úÖ Added smooth animations and touch interactions

**Result:** Interactive carousel with smooth scrolling, 3D perspective effects, and real-time filter preview.

---

### **Question 2: Integrate Practicum 1 with Practicum 2**

**Integration Implementation:**

When a user captures a photo in `TakePictureScreen`, the `XFile` object is automatically passed to `PhotoFilterCarousel`:

```dart
final image = await _controller.takePicture();
await Navigator.of(context).push(
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => PhotoFilterCarousel(imageFile: image),
  ),
);
```

The `PhotoFilterCarousel` widget checks for the presence of `imageFile`:
- **If `imageFile` exists** ‚Üí Display captured photo with filters
- **If `imageFile` is null** ‚Üí Display sample/placeholder image for demo

This creates a seamless workflow: **Capture ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Result**

**Screenshots:** See "Camera Capture Interface" and "Filter Application Screen" above for the integrated workflow.

### **Question 3: Explain the Purpose of `void async` in Practicum 1**

#### **Detailed Explanation:**

The `async` keyword in Dart is used to mark a function as asynchronous, enabling it to perform non-blocking operations.

**Key Points:**

1. **Function Signature:**
   ```dart
   void onPressed() async {
     // Asynchronous operations here
   }
   ```
   
   While declared as `void`, internally this returns `Future<void>`, meaning:
   - The function executes asynchronously
   - It doesn't return a meaningful value (void)
   - Callers can await its completion if needed

2. **Why Use `async` in Camera Operations?**
   
   Camera operations are **I/O-intensive** and must not block the UI thread:
   
   ```dart
   // ‚ùå Without async - This would freeze the UI
   final cameras = availableCameras(); // ERROR: Can't await
   
   // ‚úÖ With async - UI remains responsive
   final cameras = await availableCameras(); // Non-blocking
   ```

3. **Real Example from Our Code:**
   ```dart
   onPressed: () async {
     try {
       await _initializeControllerFuture; // Wait for camera ready
       final image = await _controller.takePicture(); // Capture photo
       await Navigator.push(...); // Navigate to filters
     } catch (e) {
       print(e); // Handle errors
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Benefits:**
   - **Non-blocking:** UI remains responsive during I/O operations
   - **Sequential code:** Write async code that reads like sync code using `await`
   - **Error handling:** Use try-catch for async operations
   - **Better UX:** No frozen screens or ANR (Application Not Responding) errors

**Best Practice:**  
For public APIs, explicitly declare `Future<void>` instead of `void async` for clarity:
```dart
Future<void> capturePhoto() async { ... }  // ‚úÖ Clear return type
```

### **Question 4: Explain the Functions of `@immutable` and `@override` Annotations**

#### **`@immutable` Annotation**

**Purpose:** Marks a class as immutable, meaning all instance fields should be `final` and unchangeable after construction.

**Implementation in Our Project:**
```dart
@immutable
class PhotoFilterCarousel extends StatefulWidget {
  const PhotoFilterCarousel({super.key, this.imageFile});
  
  final XFile? imageFile; // Must be final
  
  @override
  State<PhotoFilterCarousel> createState() => _PhotoFilterCarouselState();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Bug Prevention:** Flutter analyzer warns if non-final fields are detected
- **Performance:** Enables widget caching and efficient rebuilds
- **Predictability:** State changes are explicit and controlled
- **Testing:** Easier to test immutable objects
- **Thread Safety:** Safe to share across isolates

**Why Important in Flutter?**  
All widgets should be immutable. State changes should only happen in `State` objects, not in the widget itself.

---

#### **`@override` Annotation**

**Purpose:** Explicitly indicates that a method is overriding a superclass or interface method.

**Implementation in Our Project:**
```dart
class _PhotoFilterCarouselState extends State<PhotoFilterCarousel> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(...);
  }
  
  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Compile-time Safety:** Analyzer errors if the method doesn't actually override anything
- **Code Clarity:** Instantly shows which methods are inherited implementations
- **Refactoring Safety:** Detects broken overrides when parent classes change
- **IDE Support:** Better autocomplete and navigation
- **Documentation:** Self-documenting code for other developers

**Example Error Prevention:**
```dart
@override
Widget biuld(BuildContext context) { ... } // ‚ùå Typo caught by analyzer!
```

Without `@override`, the typo would create a new method instead of overriding `build()`, causing silent failure.

**Summary:**  
Both annotations improve code quality through static analysis. They don't change runtime behavior but prevent bugs and improve maintainability.
